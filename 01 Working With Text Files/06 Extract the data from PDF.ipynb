       " '2. performance of algorithms is evaluated based on the quality of the input data.\\n1.0.5 Types of Machine Learning\\nDepending on wheather the algorithm can self-train and predict a condtion or needs to identify\\npatterns to derive outcomes.\\n1.0.6 1. Supervised Learning\\nIn supervised learning, the algorithm learns from labeled training data, meaning each input is paired\\nwith the correct output. The model makes predictions based on this data and is corrected when\\nwrong. It is used for: - Classification : Predicting categorical outcomes (e.g., spam vs. non-spam\\nemails). - Regression : Predicting continuous outcomes (e.g., stock prices, temperature).\\nExamples : - Linear Regression - Decision T rees - Support V ector Machines (SVM)\\n1.0.7 2. Unsupervised Learning\\nIn unsupervised learning, the model learns from unlabeled data and tries to uncover hidden patterns\\nor structures. The data does not have pre-defined outputs.\\n• Clustering : Grouping similar data points (e.g., customer segmentation).\\n• Dimensionality Reduction : Reducing the number of input features (e.g., Principal Com-\\nponent Analysis).\\nExamples : - K-means clustering - Hierarchical clustering - Autoencoders\\n1.0.8 3. Semi-Supervised Learning\\nSemi-supervised learning uses a combination of labeled and unlabeled data. It is useful when\\nlabeling a large dataset is time-consuming or expensive. The model first learns from a small set of\\nlabeled data and then extends this learning to a larger set of unlabeled data.\\nExample : - Self-training algorithms\\n1.0.9 4. Reinforcement Learning\\nIn reinforcement learning, an agent learns to make decisions by interacting with an environment\\nand receiving feedback in the form of rewards or penalties. It learns to take actions that maximize\\ncumulative rewards over time.\\nExamples : - Q-learning - Deep Q-Networks (DQN) - Policy gradient methods\\n1.0.10 5. Self-Supervised Learning\\nSelf-supervised learning is a type of unsupervised learning where the data itself provides the labels.\\nThe model learns from part of the data to predict another part (e.g., predicting the next word in\\na sentence).\\nExamples : - Generative models like GPT, BER T\\n2',\n",
       " '1.0.11 6. T ransfer Learning\\nT ransfer learning allows a model trained on one task to be reused on a new but related task. This\\napproach is common when there’s limited data for the new task but abundant data for the original\\ntask.\\nExample : - Pre-trained models like ResNet, BER T, and GPT used in different domains.\\nEach type of machine learning is used for different problems, and the choice depends on the specific\\ntask and available data.\\n1.0.12 Machine Learning Pipeline\\n1. A machine learning(ML) pipeline is a series of sequential steps used to codify and automate\\nML workflows to produce ML models.\\n2. ML pipeline is an end-to-end construction that includes and orchestrates:\\n• Data extraction.\\n• Raw data input.\\n• Preprocessing.\\n• Model parameters.\\n• Model training.\\n• Deployment.\\n• Predicting outputs.\\n3. The term pipeline implies a one-way flow of data but ML pipelines are cyclical and iterative.\\n4. Every step in the sequence is repeated until a successful algorithm is achieved.\\n1.0.13 Machine Learning and Operations Professionals (MLOps)\\nMLOps is a set of practices that combines: - ML - DevOps - Data engineering\\nEnsures reliable and eﬀicient deployment and maintenance of ML models in production systems.\\nMLOps aims to: - Improve communication and collaboration between MLOps. - Shorten and\\nmanage complete development life cycle. - Ensure continuous delivery of high-quality predictive\\nservices.\\n3 phases of MLOps\\n• Design:\\n– Undersanding the business and data, and then designs the ML-powered software\\n3',\n",
